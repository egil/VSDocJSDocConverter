A small Windows program that takes VsDoc as input and renders out the corresponding JsDoc.

Usage: start the program. Find your VsDoc snippet and copy and paste it into the open window.
When a conversion is done, the content is automatically but onto the clipboard, so there is no need to select the generated JsDoc and press Control + V.
